This is my final year dissertation project's source code.

A defunct World War 2 anti-aircraft (AA) gallery, transformed into an interactive educational exhibit slash museum.  The Dome consists of numerous World War 2 and aircraft facts, replicas and artefacts as well as a main attraction the AA gun simulation. During World War 2 the Langham Dome was used to train AA Gunners, by using a disarmed AA gun where the trainee Gunners would fire the training gun at projected aircraft flying in random directions.  The optimum aimpoint was masked onto the projection with a yellow circle, and the training AA gun had a filter on its scope, the same shade of yellow As the optimum aimpoint.  Upon trigger press, a projection reticle was fired from the mock AA gun on the screen.  The reticle and its relative position to the optimum aimpoint gave examiners and trainers a good idea of the trainee Gunners natural skill.
In the modern museum this same training exercise is kept as an interactive feature, and a national heritage site.  My goal within this project was to use computer vision and robotics techniques two automate the examination process and provide an appropriate score for the user afterwards.
Although not included within the source code, the documentation proves that my final implementation of the computer vision algorithms provides an 80% accuracy.  A majority of the files within this repository are experiments and trials done to test the accuracy of algorithmic techniques.
